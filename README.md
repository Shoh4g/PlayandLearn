# Description of the game

The game is an education based text game. The subject is chemisty and the motive of the game is to act as an supplement to text books and revision guides.

The game consists of 3 levels. The three levels correspond to 3 topics of chemistry. Each level consists of 3 difficulty level: easy, medium, hard. Player starts with a certain health. Each wrong answer decreases his health by a certain point. If his health decreases below a certain level he loses the game. So everytime his health is low, he is asked whether he wants to roll dice to increase score. If his guess score matches the dice score his health increases. For the first 2 times, nothing happens if he guesses wrong. later on, wrong guess will decrease his health.  After every topic finishes, his score is displayed. If he finishes the game, he gets a report card. The report card holds the record of his performance in all topics. High score is equivalent to A whereas low score is equivalent to C and so on. He gets feedback on each topic based on his grade.

# Things which will be implemented in our Program!

## How does it implement rand():

We will try to implement a mini-lucky roll the dice within the education game. So while generating random numbers for the dice, we will rand() function to generate the number. If the guess of the user matches with the generated number, the user will gain energy points.  

## How do we use data structures?

We will use arrays use to store answers to questions, scores of the user, health of the user!

## How we are using files input and output

Output: We will be outputting questions, the player's health and score after each level, and player's report card and feedback after the game ends.
Input: The answer that the player provides for each questions
