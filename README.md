#Description of the game

The game is an education based text game. The subject is chemisty and the motive of the game is to act as an supplement to text books and revision guides.

The game consists of 3 levels. The three levels correspond to 3 topics of chemistry. Each level consists of 3 difficulty level: easy, medium, hard. Player starts with a certain health. Each wrong answer decreases his health by a certain point. If his health decreases below a certain level he loses the game. So everytime his health is low, he is asked whether he wants to roll dice to increase score. If his guess score matches the dice score his health increases. For the first 2 times, nothing happens if he guesses wrong. later on, wrong guess will decrease his health.  After every topic finishes, his score is displayed. If he finishes the game, he gets a report card. The report card holds the record of his performance in all topics. High score is equivalent to A whereas low score is equivalent to C and so on. He gets feedback on each topic based on his grade.
